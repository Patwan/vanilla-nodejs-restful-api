# RESTFUL API using Vanilla Node Framework

* In this repository, we explore the creation of a Restful API using plain Nodejs without any of its frammework e.g Express or Adonis.
* The API has full CRUD functionality of Create, Read, Update and Delete. We populate data in a Json file
but you can customize it to use a Nosql database e.g MongoDB or SQL database e.g MySQL
* We use MVC arhitectural pattern, the application logic is inside controllers folder, models are inside
models folder, we dont have C for Client since this is an API.

## Application Depedencies

* UUID - As listed in package.json, this package helps in generating a unique identifier for each record
  being stored in JSON file.
* Nodemon - A develeopment depedency for hot reloading of the server.

## Installation
* Clone the folder using **git clone**
* Run **npm install** which will read all the dependencies defined in the package.json file and automatically install them.
